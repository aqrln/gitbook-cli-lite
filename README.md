# gitbook-commander

[![Build Status][travis-badge]][travis-url]
[![Greenkeeper badge][greenkeeper-badge]][greenkeeper-url]

An alternative lightweight CLI for the awesome [GitBook][] documentation
generator that, unlike the official CLI, doesn't assume it is installed
globally (and, to the contrary, is built specifically for being used in npm
scripts) and does not install anything on its own behalf.

## Installation and Usage

```sh
$ npm install --save-dev gitbook
$ npm install --save-dev gitbook-commander
```

After that, the `gitbook-local` command will be available for you to use from
npm scripts in `package.json` or via [npx][].

For example, you may add this or something similar to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build-docs": "gitbook-local build"
  }
}
```

and run

```sh
$ npm run build-docs
```

to build your documentation. GitBook stays isolated inside your `node_modules`
